              <p>Welcome to my world of capturing moments forever.</p>

              <p>
                I am Raj Gawand, a Photographer based in Mumbai. If you haven't met me yet, let me tell you a bit about
                myself. I am basically a passionate photographer and a hardcore food lover who believes in living life
                to the fullest. Capturing moments and making people smile is something that I love doing and also is my
                Camera, which is also my best friend.
              </p>

              <p>
                Speaking a word about myself which keeps me going and always motivates me to just never stop. I believe
                in living a simple life and finding purpose in everything that I do.
              </p>

              <p>
                A huge shout of my life has also revolved around food. During my free time I love to explore new places
                and try different cuisines. I have been to various places and I must say I have the experience of
                working as a Chef at renowned 5 Star kitchens.
              </p>

              <p>
                Coming back to my Photography side, well, I am passionate about clicking pictures and I love to capture
                the most beautiful and the most real moments of them.
